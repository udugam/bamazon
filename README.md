# Bamazon Retail Store Application
This is a command line application that allows users to interact with a retail store's inventory stored in a mySQL database. 

### Database Structure
The bamazon database consists of two tables, products and departments. The following screenshots demonstrate how the two tables were setup:

### Customer Experience
The customer application (bamazonCustomer.js) allows a user to purchase products by ID. Upon launch, the products in inventory are first printed to the console before the user is prompted to make a product choice and quantity to purchase. Upon selection, the purchase total is displayed to the user and the updated store inventory is re-printed to the console.
